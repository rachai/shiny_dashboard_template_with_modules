# Shiny Dashboard Template With Modules

A template dashboard with a modular design that serves as a skeleton to get
you up and running quickly.

The dashboard contains multiple sidebar menu items, each of which sources it's 
content from a separate module.R script. 

See the Rstudio documentation on modularizing apps (https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html).

Hope this is useful for someone else.
